        # It's good to test different Node.js versions.
        # Node.js 18 and 20 are LTS (Long Term Support) versions.
        # Node.js 19 is not LTS and might have more breaking changes for some libraries.
        # Let's keep 18 and 20 for robust testing.
        node-version: [18, 20] # Removed 19 for potentially better stability with dependencies.

    steps:

        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}

          # Optional: Add caching for faster subsequent runs if your repo is large
          # cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies (npm ci)
        # This is the crucial step for reproducible builds.
        # It installs all dependencies exactly as defined in package-lock.json.
        run: npm ci

      # --- REMOVE OR COMMENT OUT THIS SECTION ---
      # - name: Install latest Vite (potentially problematic)
      #   # Running 'npm install vite@latest' after 'npm ci' can override versions
      #   # locked in package-lock.json and introduce unexpected compatibility issues.
      #   # If you want to test with the latest Vite, update it locally in your project
      #   # (npm install vite@latest) and commit the updated package.json and package-lock.json.
      #   run: npm install vite@latest
